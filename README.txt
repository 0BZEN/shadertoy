shadertoy
=========

goofing around with shadertoy

shaders are almost copypasta from shadertoy.com. With some things cut out until I get round fixing the various inputs, texture samplers, ect...

all shaders should be in the 'shaders' folder, and with the '.shader' extension. SHADERS!!!

run shadertoy.exe <shadername> <display_id> <frame_buffer_width> <frame_buffer_height>

e.g. : "shadertoy.exe leizex 2 1024 768" will run the leizex shader, on display #2, at 1024x768.
